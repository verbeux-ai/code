# Verboo Code

Verboo Code is the coding-agent CLI for the [Verboo platform](https://code.verboo.ai). It connects exclusively to Verboo's infrastructure — no API keys from external providers needed.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create an account

Sign up at [code.verboo.ai](https://code.verboo.ai).

### 2. Install

```bash
npm install -g @verboo/code
```

If the install later reports `ripgrep not found`, install ripgrep system-wide and confirm `rg --version` works in the same terminal before starting.

### 3. Run

```bash
verboo
```

On first run, Verboo Code opens your browser at `https://code.verboo.ai` to complete the OAuth login. Once authenticated, your session tokens are stored securely in your system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux libsecret). No additional configuration required.

To log in manually at any time:

```bash
verboo /login
```

## What Works

- **Tool-driven coding workflows**: Bash, file read/write/edit, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and slash commands
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time token output and tool progress
- **Tool calling**: Multi-step tool loops with model calls, tool execution, and follow-up responses
- **Images**: URL and base64 image inputs for providers that support vision

## Web Search and Fetch

`WebSearch` uses DuckDuckGo by default.

> **Note:** DuckDuckGo fallback works by scraping search results and may be rate-limited, blocked, or subject to DuckDuckGo's Terms of Service.

`WebFetch` works via basic HTTP plus HTML-to-markdown conversion. It may fail on JavaScript-rendered sites or sites that block plain HTTP requests.

## Headless gRPC Server

Verboo Code can be run as a headless gRPC service, allowing you to integrate its agentic capabilities (tools, bash, file editing) into other applications, CI/CD pipelines, or custom user interfaces. The server uses bidirectional streaming to send real-time text chunks, tool calls, and request permissions for sensitive commands.

### 1. Start the gRPC Server

Start the core engine as a gRPC service on `localhost:50051`:

```bash
npm run dev:grpc
```

#### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `GRPC_PORT` | `50051` | Port the gRPC server listens on |
| `GRPC_HOST` | `localhost` | Bind address. Use `0.0.0.0` to expose on all interfaces (not recommended without authentication) |

### 2. Run the Test CLI Client

We provide a lightweight CLI client that communicates exclusively over gRPC. It acts just like the main interactive CLI, rendering colors, streaming tokens, and prompting you for tool permissions (y/n) via the gRPC `action_required` event.

In a separate terminal, run:

```bash
npm run dev:grpc:cli
```

*Note: The gRPC definitions are located in `src/proto/verboo.proto`. You can use this file to generate clients in Python, Go, Rust, or any other language.*

## Source Build And Local Development

```bash
bun install
bun run build
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Helpful commands:

- `bun run dev`
- `bun test`
- `bun run test:coverage`
- `bun run security:pr-scan -- --base origin/main`
- `bun run smoke`
- `bun run doctor:runtime`
- `bun run verify:privacy`
- focused `bun test ...` runs for the areas you touch

## Testing And Coverage

Verboo Code uses Bun's built-in test runner for unit tests.

Run the full unit suite:

```bash
bun test
```

Generate unit test coverage:

```bash
bun run test:coverage
```

Open the visual coverage report:

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

If you already have `coverage/lcov.info` and only want to rebuild the UI:

```bash
bun run test:coverage:ui
```

Use focused test runs when you only touch one area:

- `bun run test:provider`
- `bun run test:provider-recommendation`
- `bun test path/to/file.test.ts`

Recommended contributor validation before opening a PR:

- `bun run build`
- `bun run smoke`
- `bun run test:coverage` for broader unit coverage when your change affects shared runtime or provider logic
- focused `bun test ...` runs for the files and flows you changed

Coverage output is written to `coverage/lcov.info`, and Verboo Code also generates a git-activity-style heatmap at `coverage/index.html`.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` - core CLI/runtime
- `scripts/` - build, verification, and maintenance scripts
- `docs/` - setup, contributor, and project documentation
- `python/` - standalone Python helpers and their tests
- `vscode-extension/verboo-vscode/` - VS Code extension
